Utilizing PHP and Shell, Librarian leverages data from the University of Pennsylvania's library database to scrape Library of Congress Classification Numbers for a certain book. Using this information, Librarian then points the user towards the appropriate floor and shelf.

In its current form, Librarian only has data for section 3E of the Van Pelt Dietrich Library Center. This comprises most items labelled under P (Language and Literature) and a handful of Z's (Bibliography, Library Science, and General Information Resources.) With further work, the app could be expanded to encompass all floors of Van Pelt, and eventually make its way into cataloguing other libraries as well.
